# Room of Requirement

>It is a room that a person can only enter when they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.

## Motivation
Programs are complex. Mind is limited. Mighty tools of useful abstraction and simple in use are our remedies.

As it happens in programming, sometimes we (re-)implement certain classes or functions which aren't in language's standart libraries but of great help for programmers. This suboptimal hobby by all means can be optimised. The aim of this repo to be an open-soruce collection of such inventions (ideally it would be similar to c++ boost and google's guava, but currently I can't provision any means of distribution).
